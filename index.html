                        Do not go gentle into that good night,<br />Old age should burn and rave at close of day; <br />Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br /><br />Though wise men at their end know dark is right,<br />Because their words had forked no lightning they<br />Do not go gentle into that good night.<br /><br />Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright<br />Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,<br />Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br /><br />Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,<br />And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,<br />Do not go gentle into that good night.<br /><br />Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight<br />Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,<br />Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br /><br />And you, my father, there on that sad height,<br />Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.<br />Do not go gentle into that good night.<br />Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

                        Now as I was young and easy under the apple boughs<br>About the lilting house and happy as the grass was green,<br>The night above the dingle starry,<br>Time let me hail and climb<br>Golden in the heydays of his eyes,<br>And honoured among wagons I was prince of the apple towns<br>And once below a time I lordly had the trees and leaves<br>Trail with daisies and barley<br>Down the rivers of the windfall light.<br><br>And as I was green and carefree, famous among the barns<br>About the happy yard and singing as the farm was home,<br>In the sun that is young once only,<br>Time let me play and be<br>Golden in the mercy of his means,<br>And green and golden I was huntsman and herdsman, the calves<br>Sang to my horn, the foxes on the hills barked clear and<br>cold,<br>And the sabbath rang slowly<br>In the pebbles of the holy streams.<br><br>All the sun long it was running, it was lovely, the hay<br>Fields high as the house, the tunes from the chimneys, it was<br>air<br>And playing, lovely and watery<br>And fire green as grass.<br>And nightly under the simple stars<br>As I rode to sleep the owls were bearing the farm away,<br>All the moon long I heard, blessed among stables, the<br>nightjars<br>Flying with the ricks, and the horses<br>Flashing into the dark.<br><br>And then to awake, and the farm, like a wanderer white<br>With the dew, come back, the cock on his shoulder: it was all<br>Shining, it was Adam and maiden,<br>The sky gathered again<br>And the sun grew round that very day.<br>So it must have been after the birth of the simple light<br>In the first, spinning place, the spellbound horses walking<br>warm<br>Out of the whinnying green stable<br>On to the fields of praise.<br><br>And honoured among foxes and pheasants by the gay house<br>Under the new made clouds and happy as the heart was long,<br>In the sun born over and over,<br>I ran my heedless ways,<br>My wishes raced through the house high hay<br>And nothing I cared, at my sky blue trades, that time allows<br>In all his tuneful turning so few and such morning songs<br>Before the children green and golden<br>Follow him out of grace.<br><br>Nothing I cared, in the lamb white days, that time would<br>take me<br>Up to the swallow thronged loft by the shadow of my hand,<br>In the moon that is always rising,<br>Nor that riding to sleep<br>I should hear him fly with the high fields<br>And wake to the farm forever fled from the childless land.<br>Oh as I was young and easy in the mercy of his means,<br>Time held me green and dying<br>Though I sang in my chains like the sea.
